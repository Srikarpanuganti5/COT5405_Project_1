# COT5405_Project_1 Greedy and Divide-and-Conquer in Practice:
MRI Day Scheduling and Drone Closest–Pair
Detection (Java Implementation)


We present two real application problems and solve
them with classical paradigms: (1) maximizing completed MRI
appointments in a single suite via an earliest-finish greedy
policy; and (2) detecting the closest pair among simultane-
ously reported drone positions via a near-linear-time divide-
and-conquer method. We formalize the problems with simple
abstractions (interval sets; planar point sets), provide algorithms,
running-time analyses, and correctness proofs, and implement
both in Java. We validate the O(n log n) predictions empirically,
plotting Java-generated CSV results directly in L A T EX. We include
methodology flowcharts, a combined Results & Broader Impact
section, and a Future Work roadmap. All source code (Java)
and an LLM-usage appendix are provided for reproducibility
and compliance.
